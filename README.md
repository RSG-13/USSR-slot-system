## License
You can't modify, use, share and etc. that code.  **__I do__**.<br/>
You still can use this code to play the [game](https://store.steampowered.com/app/1281930/tModLoader/) (if you subscribed on it in steam workshop) and as an example for your own mods<br/>
(yes i won't be mad at you for that, i also used other mods repositories as example, but remember that i'll still be mad at you if you copy-paste the whole project and say that you made it).<br/>
No i won't change license just because you want.<br/>

## How to contribute
If you really want to help in development([C#](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/) knowledge needed) or spotted a ***bug*** - text me in discord.<br/>
I usually answer in less than an hour in discord so it's highly reccomended to text me there.<br/>

## About decompiled files
Some releases will be marked as decompiled or decomp that means that i lost access to that build and restored files from steam workshop.<br/>
These builds should be treated as unstable dev builds. Use them as example on your own risk, because i've written code in a different way.<br/>
Here's example of [decompiled code](https://github.com/RSG-13/USSR-slot-system/edit/main/decompiled-0.2/)

## Features - known issues or bugs that i won't be fixing ever
`
btw you can also wear wings and celestial tracers at the same time, you have to put the celestial tracers in boot slot and then right click the wings and it will be put in the wing slot

Thanks [Iaro](https://steamcommunity.com/id/yaroslav0808) for that info.<br/>
